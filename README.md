Basically we just have a general inquiry from one of our users they wanted to know when there would be a hardware refresh. with this request since it was general and not assigned to anyonme I will assign the proper Sev and alert karen about the new update and once resolved move the ticket to resloved.

Basically we updated the ticket to what user jane submitted a little while ago. I uodated the SEV to A which in our department means it has to be resolved in 24 hours, also updated this ticket to emergency since the entire mobile banking system is down and we moved this ticket to support, another department that would be able to properly handle this.
